Using public data to build investment portfolio. Real time updates will be provided. 

With the increase in real time information through social media a lot of attention has been focused on rapid and reactive methods of investing and trading using available public data. I myself have attempted to code algorithimic trading scripts that used sentiment analysis from both Twitter and Reddit for real time trading. While this has its unique approach, I wondered the effectiveness of using public data to collect information in a slower, comprehensive manner to build a stock portfolio over time. 

Here is the basic outline of what I have in mind:

- I will be mainly focusing on Reddit because as a platform users are more likely to provide geniune analysis, opinions and sentiments as opposed to Twitter where it is much harder to go in depth. Reddit also is the most accessible public data source for an individual developer. 

- I will scrape posts, comments, and other data I find relevant along the way on r/stocks, r/investing, r/options, r/wallstreetbets, and r/economics. 

- As of now I plan to scrape posts that talk about a specific stock/industry and anlayze engagement and sentiment on the post. I hope to include/discover other form of analysis as I go on. 

- When I add a stock to my portfolio, I will continue to monitor it's performance on the various subreddits. I will also purchase relative percentages of each stock based on the overall system I choose to evaluate the potential investments I find from the data. 

- I think it will also be useful to include a cross reference check with overall news and google searches for a stock ticker. This should not be hard to do. 

- I need to come up with metrics for choosing when to close an open position. I also have not decided if I am going to play with options. 

- I plan to code the project in Python despite spending an entire semester coding in Java. 

- Finally "dubao" is a literal translation of "forecast" in Vietnamese. This project is motivated by a special Viet in my life.
